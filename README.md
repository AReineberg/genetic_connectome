# genetic_connectome

My collaborator, Alex Hatoum, is maintaining the code we used for all genetic analyses in the manuscript in the [wildcard toolbox repository](https://github.com/AlexHatoum/Wild-Card-Toolbox). That toolbox can parallelize twin models in R which is useful for looping through many brain variables (voxels, connections, vertices).
